## Stack Class
The Stack class is a templated implementation of a stack data structure, based on the Vector class. It provides functionality to store and manipulate elements in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner. The Stack class is defined in the "Stack.hpp" header file and depends on the "Vector.hpp" header file.
# Features
The Stack class provides the following features:
  - Pushing elements onto the stack
  - Pushing elements onto the stack
  - Popping elements from the stack
  - Accessing the top element of the stack
  - Checking if the stack is empty
  - Retrieving the size of the stack
  - Swapping the contents of two stacks
# Usage
To use the Stack class, follow these steps:
  - Include the "Stack.hpp" header file in your source code.
  - Create a Stack object with the desired element type.
  - Use the available member functions to manipulate the stack.
